# Animated Emissive Intensity

Learn how you can animate the elusive "Intensity" property on the color picker in this beginner friendly tutorial! 

A common need when dealing with emissive properties is to set the Intensity property. However, as you can see from the [Unity Color docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html) you'll find this isn't an available property! In this tutorial you'll learn how you can edit and animate this property with an AnimationCurve to get some cool and spooky effects, just in time for Halloween! 

This is a relatively low effort, low cost effect you can add to your game for a halloween update!
